Wave A Flag Write-Up
Description: Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? This program has extraordinarily helpful information...

Before we start, there is a file we need to download, so we can use the following command,
wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/f95b1ee9f29d631d99073e34703a2826/warm

After we get the file named warm, we can’t run it right away. The next step would be to create an executable by running the following command:
       chmod +x warm
After which, we can run the file using the command: 
       ./warm
Finally, we get the following after following the instructions,
       spingy-picoctf@webshell:~/GeneralSkills/WaveAFlag$ ./warm
       Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
       spingy-picoctf@webshell:~/GeneralSkills/WaveAFlag$ ./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_f0668f62}
