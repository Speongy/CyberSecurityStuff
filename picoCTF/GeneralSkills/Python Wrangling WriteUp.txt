Python Wrangling Write-up
Description: Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run this Python script using this password to get the flag?

There are three files to download before we begin. Our python script ende.py, pw.txt, and flag.txt.en. we can use the following command to get these files:
wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/325a52d249be0bd3811421eacd2c877a/ende.py
wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/325a52d249be0bd3811421eacd2c877a/pw.txt
wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/325a52d249be0bd3811421eacd2c877a/flag.txt.en


After we grab these, we can run the following command to start the process:
	python ende.py -d flag.txt.en
We are then prompted to enter a password, which is in our password text file. After inputting the password, we are greeted with the flag. 
	picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_ac9bd0ff}
